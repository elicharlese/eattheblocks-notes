# thirdweb on-chain registry

## On-Chain Registry

- maps every contract that you deploy to a version
- all contract data is stored on IFPS with a version

## Registry vs. Factory

1. The "factory" is the smart contract you interact with to deploy a pre-built contract
2. The "registry" is the smart contract that tracks the addressses of the contracts you deployed
    - A description of the contracts' functions
    - Name (can use ENS)
    - The contracts' extensions
    - The past versions

## Release (Deploy our contract)

- Run `npx thirdweb release` to deploy our contract
- This will be a deprecated version of thirdweb documentation
- So instead we will be running the `deploy` or `publish` command
