# Deploying our contract

## 3 different ways for Deploying

- From the public contract webpage
- npx thirdweb deploy
- Directly from thirdweb dashboard

If we go to our dashboard there will be a list of all our contracts. If we know which contract we can select and deploy.
If not it will have an option at the top that asks if we need help choosing. If we need.

## Adding a claim phase

- First we will set claim conditions
- Then we will go to the NFT's page. Then we will upload the NFTs.
- We can then choose our Delayed Reveal features and enter our password for thirdweb.
- Select the Reveal NFT's button after they have successfully uploaded.

## The we will look at our SDK's

- We have the following languages already written in the SDK's: React, JavaScript, Python and Go
- Going through the examples we will need to install thirdweb SDK for python using `pip install thirdweb-sdk`
