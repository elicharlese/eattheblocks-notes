# Why use thirdweb contract templates and SDK

## Speed
- Unless it is completely custom idea; you wont need a completely custom solution
- You can always find a similar contract to begin with, build off or inspire your custom integration
- You can always go with the contract wizard so that it generates options for you
- But you can also use thirdweb extensions so you can customize and build functionality on top of the contract

- You should think about the contracts as building blocks for the contract
- Piece things together that fit in order to make what you want

- These blocks will be packed together in Base Contracts
- The extensions will be small blocks which are fully customizable for you to add to your contracts
