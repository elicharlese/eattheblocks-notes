Meta-Bridge: state sync without any mapping.

This is essentially equivalent to the ability to transfer tokens without the need for proper mapping.

This has opened the possibility to map onto alternate protocols so long as they has a method of mapping between different protocols. For example, Arbitrum and Polygon.
