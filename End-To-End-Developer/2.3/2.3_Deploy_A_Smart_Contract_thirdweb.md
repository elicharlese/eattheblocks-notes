# Streamline the process with thirdweb

1. First we will create a new directory for contracts `mkdir contracts`
2. Then well make a contract `touch Greeter.sol`
3. Next we will initialize our environment `npm init`
4. Next we will install thirdweb's CLI `npm i @thirdweb-dev/cli`
5. Just copy the Greeter.sol contract code from the previous project

6. Then we will use thirdweb

`npx thirdweb detect`
- Compiles your contract
- Detects extensions implemented
- Suggests other extensions

`npx thirdweb release`
- Publishes your smart contract on thirdweb on-chain smart contract registry
- Create a public landing page for both your wallet and your smart contract

`npx thirdweb deploy`
- We can go with the solc compiler instead
- Once it is done commpiling, you can copy the address and go to the thirdweb browser

7. You will arrive at the dashboard and you will be able to apply the parameters to deploy the contract
- Our contract has a constructor with a greeting string attached
- You can choose your network
- Make sure you have test_funds avaibale in your wallet
- Pay only for the gas to run the contract
- Finally we will be in the explorer
- We can see our parameters but we can also call our function
- We can also see our events, our hash, block number and GreetingSet
- We get a code tab to help us directly to implement our smart contracts
- You will also have access to the ABI bytecode
- There is also a link to the Etherscan page
