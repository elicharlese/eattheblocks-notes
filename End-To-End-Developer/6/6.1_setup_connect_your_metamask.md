# Edition Drop Example

1. We will create a new Eiditon Drop contract. Then we will input the information and run the contract.
2. Then we will add our minters/cretors to the contract through the dashboard (update the permissions)
3. Then we will add some NFTs to our collection so we can mint them. (Batch upload)
4. After we upload we will use the SDK that is in the code tab
5. We then use the typescript template by running `npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter`
6. We cd into the directory and `yarn dev` will render the application
7. It is a blank page with a connect wallet button.
8. We connect to metamask.
9. We see the connect wallet button is using a hook from thirdweb.
