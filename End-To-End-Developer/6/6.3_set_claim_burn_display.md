# We want to display more information about our NFT's owned and display them so that they are visible

## React Hooks

2. So now that we have displayed more information about the NFT's owned and display them so that they are visible
3. We will now use the SDK to set the claim conditions as opposed to using the Dashboard
4. We can also set a button to burn the NFT's using the SDK
